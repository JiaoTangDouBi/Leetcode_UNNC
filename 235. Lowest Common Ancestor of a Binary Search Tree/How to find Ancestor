This question can be easily divided into two cases:
  1. The ancestor is neither p or q.
  2. The ancestor is either p or q.
  
Due to the feature of BST (Left < node < right), it is easy to determine the position of p and q according to the value of 
current root. 
  For p < q, 
    1. if root.left == p && root.val < q.val, then q must be in the right hand side, so current node is their
    ancestor.
    2. if root.left == p && root.val > q.val, then q must be in the same side of p (left), so p is their ancestor.
  Same to q >= p.
